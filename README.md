## Features

- **macOS-style "traffic light"** window control buttons.

- Minimalist design that stays out of your way.
- Clear visual distinction between active and inactive windows.

## Installation

### Using Git (Obviously)

This is the easiest way to install and stay up-to-date.

1.  Open a terminal.
2.  The theme needs to be in `~/.local/share/aurorae/themes/`. First, make sure the directory exists:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/aurorae/themes/
    ```
3.  Clone the repository directly into that directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/parv141206/AmoledMac.git ~/.local/share/aurorae/themes/AmoledMac
    ```

## Activation

1.  Open **System Settings**.
2.  Navigate to **Appearance** > **Window Decorations**.
3.  You should see **"AmoledMac"** in the list of themes. Select it.
4.  Click **Apply** in the bottom right.

The changes should apply instantly. If you don't see the theme in the list after installing it, try logging out and logging back in to refresh KDE's theme cache.
